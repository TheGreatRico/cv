# Repository to store my résumé/CV
**Currently I am on the job hunt**, so for simplicity of sharing my CV, I am posting it here.

There are 2 up-to-date versions of custom made CVs on different languages: [russian](Russian_Shevnin_DataScientist.pdf) and [english](English_Shevnin_DataScientist.pdf). They contain brief summary of my projects, skills, education and my contacts.

*Hyperlinks do not work when viewing the git version so it's best to download pdf's to be able to click on any web link listed in the doc: from email to repository links.*
